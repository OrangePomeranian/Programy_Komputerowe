# Transcriptor of nucleotide to amino acid sequences

A program that transcribes nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequences written in Python.

For a given nucleotide sequence, the program generates the corresponding amino acid sequence by transcribing triplets into amino acid codes. The operations occur on a data file in the FASTA format indicated by the user. As a result, the program generates another FASTA file.

The genetic code used is the human genetic code. The program can transcribe both DNA and RNA sequences.
